         * 
         * TODO: Every time the button is clicked, the number in the "count" element should increase by 1.
         * 
         * Hint: On top of grabbing the "count" and "button" elements by their id, you will need to keep track of some variable
         * representing the current value in your code.

        // CODE HERE


        /* OPTIONAL PRACTICE: If you want more practice later, create another button that decreases the count by 1. */
